# Portfolio
A CSS portfolio is a web-based collection of work showcasing an individual's skills, projects, and accomplishments in a visually appealing and organized manner. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to design and style the portfolio, enhancing its aesthetic appeal and ensuring a responsive layout across different devices.
